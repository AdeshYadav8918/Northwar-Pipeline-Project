# Northwar CI/CD Pipeline Project

<!-- 📋 Project Overview -->

A complete CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys a website to port 82 when changes are pushed to the master branch, while only building (no deployment) for the develop branch.

<!-- 🎯 Project Requirements -->

✅ Git workflow implementation (master/develop branches)

✅ AWS CodeBuild triggers on commit to master or develop branches

✅ Master branch: Build + Publish website on port 82

✅ Develop branch: Build only (no publication)

✅ Complete CI/CD pipeline implementation

✅ Ubuntu + Apache container for building

✅ Website served from 'Northwar.html'

FROM ubuntu:22.04
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y apache2 git curl awscli
RUN echo "Listen 82" >> /etc/apache2/ports.conf

version: 0.2
phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - cp index.html Northwar.html
  post_build:
    commands:
      - |
        if echo "$CODEBUILD_WEBHOOK_TRIGGER" | grep -q "master"; then
          echo "DEPLOYING to port 82"
          # Deployment commands here

🔧 Branch Behavior
Branch	Trigger	Action	Result
master	Push commit	Build + Deploy	Website published on port 82
develop	Push commit	Build only	Artifacts created, no deployment
Other	Push commit	Build only	Artifacts created, no deployment
🧪 Testing the Pipeline
Test Develop Branch:
bash
git checkout develop
echo "<!-- Develop test -->" >> index.html
git add . && git commit -m "Test develop" && git push origin develop
# Result: Build runs, no deployment
Test Master Branch:
bash
git checkout main
git merge develop
echo "<!-- Master test -->" >> index.html
git add . && git commit -m "Test master" && git push origin main
# Result: Build runs + deploys to EC2 port 82
📊 Monitoring
AWS Console Locations:
CodePipeline: View pipeline execution status

CodeBuild: Check build logs and artifacts

CloudWatch: Detailed logs for troubleshooting

EC2: Verify Apache service on port 82

S3: Review build artifacts

Verify Deployment:
bash
# Test website on port 82
curl http://EC2_PUBLIC_IP:82/Northwar.html
🚨 Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Pipeline not triggering	Check GitHub webhook in CodePipeline settings
CodeBuild fails	Verify ECR permissions in IAM role
EC2 not accessible	Check security group allows port 82
Apache not on port 82	Verify /etc/apache2/ports.conf has Listen 82
Branch detection fails	Check $CODEBUILD_WEBHOOK_TRIGGER in buildspec
💰 Cost Optimization
Use t2.micro instances (free tier eligible)

Configure S3 lifecycle policies for artifacts

Use CloudWatch alarms for budget monitoring

Schedule non-production resources to stop overnight

📝 Key Features
Automated Builds: Triggered on every commit

Branch-Specific Logic: Different behavior for master/develop

Containerized Builds: Consistent build environment

Port 82 Deployment: Unique port for production website

Infrastructure as Code: All configurations in version control
